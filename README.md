# weatherbot
üå°Ô∏è  Telegram Bot that tells current weather based on user's location or city name.

The first bot I built to understand APIs in general, Telegram API and how Telegram Bots work.

It asks to share location or enter name of the city. Location can be shared by pressing specified button on the 
bot's special keyboard. Bot returns description of current weather, temperature, air humidity and wind speed. It is done 
through OpenWeatherMap API.

The bot also has a special feature connected with my cats :) if you enter cat's name, it shows weather in the city
they are currently living.

All necessary modules are listed in requirements.txt
